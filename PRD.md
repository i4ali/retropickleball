---

### 1. Overview & Vision

We are creating a simple, addictive, retro-styled pickleball browser game. Tapping into the massive growth of pickleball and the broad appeal of nostalgia, this game will offer a fun, accessible experience for casual gamers and pickleball fans alike. The vision is to establish a foothold in the browser gaming space with a polished, high-quality "single-purpose" game that can be monetized in the future.

### 2. Goals & Objectives

* **User Goal:** To have a fun, easy-to-learn, and instantly playable game to pass the time.
* **Business Goal (V1.0):** To launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that validates the core gameplay loop and attracts an initial user base. Success will be measured by user engagement and account sign-ups.

### 3. Target Audience

* **Primary:** Casual gamers (age 25-55) looking for a quick distraction or "coffee break" game on a desktop browser.
* **Secondary:** Pickleball enthusiasts (age 30-65+) who would enjoy a digital representation of their favorite sport.

### 4. Core Features & User Stories (V1.0)

This initial version is focused on a streamlined, single-player experience.

| Feature ID | Feature Name          | User Story                                                                                                                     | Priority  |
| :--------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- |
| **F-01** | Instant Guest Play    | As a new user, I want to start playing against an AI immediately upon visiting the site, so I can try the game with zero friction. | Must-Have |
| **F-02** | Core Gameplay Loop    | As a player, I want to control a paddle to play a simple game of pickleball against an AI opponent and have the score tracked.    | Must-Have |
| **F-03** | User Account Creation | As a player, I want to create a simple account using an email and password, so I can save my game history and high scores.        | Must-Have |
| **F-04** | Score Saving          | As a signed-in player, I want my match results (win/loss) and high scores to be saved to my profile automatically.             | Must-Have |
| **F-05** | Basic AI Opponent     | As a player, I want the AI opponent to have a single, balanced difficulty level that provides a fun and reasonable challenge.     | Must-Have |

### 5. Design & Aesthetics

* **Visual Style:** 16-bit pixel art aesthetic (similar to the Super Nintendo / Sega Genesis era). This provides a polished retro feel that stands out from more basic 2D games.
* **Audio:** Chiptune sound effects for paddle hits, ball bounces, and scoring events. A simple, upbeat chiptune music track will play in the background and can be muted.
* **User Interface (UI):** The UI will be minimalist, using clear, pixelated fonts. Screens will include:
    * **Start Screen:** Title, a "Quick Play" button, and a "Login/Sign Up" button.
    * **Game Screen:** The court, players, ball, and a simple score display (e.g., "PLAYER: 5 - AI: 3").
    * **Game Over Screen:** Displays the final score and prompts the user to "Play Again" or return to the main menu.

### 6. Monetization

V1.0 will be entirely free to play and will not contain any advertisements. The focus is on building an audience and a quality product first. Monetization strategies (e.g., unobtrusive banner ads, ad-free premium version) will be explored in future versions.

### 7. Success Metrics (for V1.0)

* **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Number of unique users playing the game each day.
* **Average Session Length:** How long the average user plays the game per visit.
* **Account Creation Rate:** The percentage of guest players who create an account.

### 8. Out of Scope for V1.0

* Multiplayer (player vs. player).
* Global leaderboards.
* Multiple AI difficulty levels.
* Player customization (paddles, outfits, etc.).
* Advanced pickleball rules (e.g., detailed kitchen faults, serving rules).
